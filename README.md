# Procedural-generation-game-windows-build
 Unity 3D roguelite game with procedurally generated world 
This is a demo test build in no way ready for release. All art and GFX assets are placeholders.

Player starts in a town area populated by a few NPCs
The blue-light square is the entrance to the dungeon.
Jumping off the ground in the dungeon will teleport the player back to the town and increase the difficulty


Controls:
WASD - directional movement
Mouselook - camera movement
SPACE - jump
Shift - dodge roll
Middle-mouse click - Inspect: when pointing at an object, provides information
Left-click - uses basic attack
Right-click - uses defense ability if available
Q - uses special attack if available
E - uses heal if available
Pressing 1,2,3,4 in front of the corresponding NPC will provide new skills and change between said skills in the same skillslot
(At the moment there are 2 different skills for every slot so pressing each number twice near the skill seller npc will exhaust
all possibilities and you can change between them with the other npc)
